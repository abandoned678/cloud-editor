China Software Cup - the design and development of online editors based on the collaboration of large and small models will guide the participating teams to create an online document editor product that combines AI large models and small models, featuring high intelligence, smooth user experience, comprehensive functions, and excellent performance, leveraging PaddlePaddle and Wenxin large models.
Intelligent polishing: Using a large language model, common writing assistance functions such as summarization, modification, continuation, incorrect sentence rewriting, translation, etc. are implemented based on context. Multimedia Information Extraction: Utilizing multimodal perception technologies such as OCR, object detection, and speech recognition, it enables online information extraction of multimedia information such as images (such as screenshots, posters, PDFs, etc.), speech, and even videos, and allows users to organically integrate content into editors. Intelligent Format Layout: Based on content type recognition, automatic format layout is performed, such as automatically adjusting font, font size, line spacing, etc. Multiple layout templates are provided for users to choose from.
